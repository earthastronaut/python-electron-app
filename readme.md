## Install

```
npm install
npm start

# Security!

Your local web server is susceptible to attacks, especially CSRF attacks. You'll need to secure the frontend/backend communication wih a token. 

# Alternatives

Instead of electron there is a python alternative called [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/).
